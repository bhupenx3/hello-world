Hello People_

It's Bhupen here, I like front end web developing with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, AngularJS. Rather than trying to do everything well, I decided to just do a few things brilliantly.

I pride myself on coding clean, semantic HTML and having a strong attention to detail. It is very important to ensure a website meets the design requirements, and the site functions across all major browsers. I am also a strong proponent of responsive design, as it ensures a website will adapt to all devices and browsers.

I am always happy to hear from you, whether you just want to say hi or get a full proposal.

Happy Coding_
